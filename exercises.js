// # problem 1 
//instructions: given an array with the values [1, 2, 3], use a for loop to log out each of the values sequentially. This is for the purpose of showing how iteration works without diving into methods.

// # problem 2
//instructions: given an array with the values of [1, 2, 3], use the .forEach method to log out each of the values sequentially

// # problem 3
//instructions: given an array with the values [1, 2, 3], create a new array that stores all of the values +1. This requires the use of the .map method. After you have created the new array, log out the values of the new array using .forEach

//# problem 4
//instructions: given an array with the values [1, 2, 3], use the .reduce method to add all the values together. After you have the new value stored, log it out.
